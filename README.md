# sveltekit tailwind (unofficial)

This project was created using [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte). It is based on the [`skeleton`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte/templates/skeleton) template.

Adding Tailwind CSS to the skeleton was done following the [Install Tailwind CSS with SvelteKit](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit) guide.

Easiest way to start:

```bash
npx degit aktiveer/sveltekit-tailwindcss svelte-site
cd svelte-site
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm istall

# OR 

yarn

```

Starting the dev environment:

```bash
npm run dev

# OR 

yarn dev

```


Below is the rest of the README.md as created by `create-svelte`.

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
